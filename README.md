# google_homepage
Recreation of the Google homepage using only HTML and CSS. It's not a functional page, I'm only trying to make it look like google.ca as way to practice my skills.

This project is a part from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).
